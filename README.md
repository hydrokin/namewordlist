# Wordlist Generator

This Python script generates wordlists of a specified length using all the letters of the alphabet, following the rule that a vowel must always come after a consonant.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

3. Run the script by entering the following command:

   ```
   python wordlist_generator.py
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to specify the desired word length (it should be an even number).

5. The script will generate wordlists and display the progress percentage while saving the results to a file named `wordlist.txt` in the same directory.

## Example

Here's how to use the script:

- Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/wordlist-generator.git
   ```

- Navigate to the script directory:

   ```
   cd wordlist-generator
   ```

- Run the script:

   ```
   python wordlist_generator.py
   ```

- Follow the on-screen instructions, enter the desired word length (e.g., 4).

- The script will generate wordlists, display the progress percentage, and save the results to a file named `wordlist.txt`.
